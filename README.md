# Sentiment-Analysis
 Worked on a NLP project based on Movie Review System by giving  TMDB API databse connectivity with the help of NLTK libraries in  Python and making the project adeptive by using Tkinter.  Lexicon Based approach is applied in the project which uses lexicons  of words that have been manually labelled as positive, negative and  neutral.
